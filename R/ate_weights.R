#' Calculate average treatment effect using inverse propensity score weighting
#'
#' Propensity scores (PS) are calculated using fitted values obtained in a logistic regression. The inverse propensity score weighting is subsequently conducted
#' by 1/PS for the factor level that corresponds to 1 and by 1/(1-PS) for the factor level that corresponds to 0.
#' @param data Character vector specifying rownames of the table (empty columns should be named with "").
#' @param vars variables tested for Influence on outcome.
#' @inheritParams mice::mice
#' @param prop.var variable for which propensity scores should be calculated
